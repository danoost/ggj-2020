One player can play on the keyboard, but it's recommended to use 2-4 Xbox controllers, as use of the joystick can give you an advantage. This is a strictly multiplayer game - it's not much fun alone (nor does it really work properly)!

We used Unity 2019.2.19f1. The game has not been tested on any newer versions, or any platform other than Windows. You can download old versions of Unity at the [Download Archive](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive).
